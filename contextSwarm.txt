Flocking behaviour refers to the way that groups of birds, insects, fish, or other animals, move close to each other. They are able to move as a group with the same velocity, yet without running into each other.
The attributes are xm, ym as the (X,Y) position of each boid, xVeln, yVeln as the velocity vector, xAm, yAm as the alignment vector, xSm, ySm as the separation vector, xCm, yCm as the cohesion vector, nACm as the number of boids the radius of Alignment/Cohesion, and nSm as the number of boids in the radius of Separation. These attributes are repeated for all m boids, where m=1,â€¦,200. Also, class labels are binary, which 1 refers to flocking, grouped, and aligned, and 0 refers to not flocking, not grouped, and not aligned.
